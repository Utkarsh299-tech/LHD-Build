# LHD-Build
This repository consists of some of the projects built during the Local Hack Day: Build event, a one week long event, organized by Major League Hacking community. 
You can see these projects [here](https://devpost.com/singhutkarsh2799)

## 1.Emojicode
<p align="center"><img src="https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/001/341/808/datas/original.jpg"></p>

Emojicode is a real programming language with playful syntax like üòÄ üî§Hhttps://github.com/Utkarsh299-tech/LHD-Build/settingsello, world!üî§‚ùóÔ∏è in place of traditional programming keywords. Learning it can bring some smiles and fun to your programming journey, as well be an enlightening experience in which you will never look at your go-to programming language the same way again.

### What this code does?
Prints initials of the name. Also, prints the name entered by the user. [Reference](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-emojicode)

## 2.Dataset Project: Natural Language Processing
<p align="center"><img src="https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/001/341/495/datas/original.jpg"></p>

### What it does?
This project classifies whether your mail is 'ham'(good) or 'spam'(bad).

### How we built it?
Using Machine Learning `scikit` library and the basic concepts of Natural Language Processing. Also, used [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for writing and executing the code.

***Machine Learning***

Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. 
It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

***Natural Language Processing***

Natural Language Processing, usually shortened as NLP, is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and humans using the natural language.
The ultimate objective of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of the human languages in a manner that is valuable.

***Scikit Library***

Open-source ML library for Python. Built on NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. Want to learn more about this library? [Click here!](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## 3. API Project: Random Word Generator
<p align="center"><img src="https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/001/342/725/datas/original.png"></p>

Random Word Generator that connects two APIs and pulls from a separate API that gives you those word definitions. We can easily generate a random word and it's definitions by connecting both the APIs.

### How we built it?
Connecting two APIs: 1) https://dictionaryapi.com/products/api-collegiate-dictionary 2) https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home

### What we learned?
JavaScript concepts, how APIs work, and how to connect two APIs.

## 4. Sorting a List
Sorting a list means arranging the items of the list in either ascending, descending or user defined order.
There are various sorting techniques. Some of them are:
Quick sort
Bubble sort
Merge sort
Insertion sort
Selection sort
Heap sort
Radix sort
Bucket sort

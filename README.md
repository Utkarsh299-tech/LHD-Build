# LHD-Build
This repository consists of some of the projects built during the Local Hack Day: Build event, a one week long event, organized by Major League Hacking community. 
You can see these projects [here](https://devpost.com/singhutkarsh2799)

## 1.Emojicode
<p align="center"><img src="https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/001/341/808/datas/original.jpg"></p>

Emojicode is a real programming language with playful syntax like üòÄ üî§Hhttps://github.com/Utkarsh299-tech/LHD-Build/settingsello, world!üî§‚ùóÔ∏è in place of traditional programming keywords. Learning it can bring some smiles and fun to your programming journey, as well be an enlightening experience in which you will never look at your go-to programming language the same way again.

### What this code does?
Prints initials of the name. Also, prints the name entered by the user. [Reference](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-emojicode)

## 2.Dataset Project: Natural Language Processing
<p align="center"><img src="https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/001/341/495/datas/original.jpg"></p>

### What it does?
This project classifies whether your mail is 'ham'(good) or 'spam'(bad).

### How we built it?
Using Machine Learning `scikit` library and the basic concepts of Natural Language Processing. Also, used [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for writing and executing the code.

***Machine Learning***

Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. 
It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

***Natural Language Processing***

Natural Language Processing, usually shortened as NLP, is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and humans using the natural language.
The ultimate objective of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of the human languages in a manner that is valuable.

***Scikit Library***

Open-source ML library for Python. Built on NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. Want to learn more about this library? [Click here!](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## 3. API Project: Random Word Generator
<p align="center"><img src="https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/001/342/725/datas/original.png"></p>

Random Word Generator that connects two APIs and pulls from a separate API that gives you those word definitions. We can easily generate a random word and it's definitions by connecting both the APIs.

### How we built it?
Connecting two APIs: 1) https://dictionaryapi.com/products/api-collegiate-dictionary 2) https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home

### What we learned?
JavaScript concepts, how APIs work, and how to connect two APIs.

## 4. Sorting a List

Sorting a list means arranging the items of the list in either ascending, descending or user defined order.

There are various sorting techniques. Some of them are:

Quick sort

Bubble sort

## What is Selection Sort?

The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

1) The subarray which is already sorted.

2) Remaining subarray which is unsorted.

In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.

Following example explains the above steps:

```
arr[] = 64 25 12 22 11

// Find the minimum element in arr[0...4]
// and place it at beginning
11 25 12 22 64

// Find the minimum element in arr[1...4]
// and place it at beginning of arr[1...4]
11 12 25 22 64

// Find the minimum element in arr[2...4]
// and place it at beginning of arr[2...4]
11 12 22 25 64

// Find the minimum element in arr[3...4]
// and place it at beginning of arr[3...4]
11 12 22 25 64
```

Merge sort

Insertion sort

Selection sort

Heap sort

Radix sort

Bucket sort

## What it does?

This code sorts a list entered by the user and returns a list in sorted order. Selection sort is used for sorting the list.
